            <li><strong>Control Scheme</strong>: Play with original Analog controls or PSP-style from later games.</li>
            <li><strong>Village Quests</strong>: Allows you to toggle an alternative method for the game to randomize which quests appear every time you enter the village, which not only shows more quests each time, but also includes brand new gathering quests unlocked after each Urgent quest.</li>

            <li><strong>Aspect Ratio</strong>: Adjust the FOV of the game, allowing the game to display its world in 4:3, 16:9 or even 21:9 aspect ratios.</li>
            <li><strong>Camera Height</strong>: Allows you to set the starting camera height when you start a quest.</li>

            <li>The barrel next to the Village Chief now acts as a complete item box.</li>
            <li>Fixes the behavior of the ESP skill to be in-line with an official patch distributed by Capcom, as well as later games in the series.</li>
            <ul><li>The x0.5 penalty for attacking too late is restored, and can now be lifted by using the ESP skill.</li></ul>
